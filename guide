if re.search('date', res):
        date = obj.tell_me_date()
        print(date)
        print(t2s(date))

    if re.search('time', res):
        time = obj.tell_me_time()
        print(time)
        t2s(time)
Open Any Website: This ‘obj.website_opener(domain)’ will open any website for you. You just need to fetch domain from user input then pass to ‘obj.website_opener(domain)’. It will open website in your default browser.

while True:
    res = obj.mic_input()

    if re.search('open', res):
        domain = res.split(' ')[-1]
        open_result = obj.website_opener(domain)
        print(open_result)
Launch any Applications, Games etc:

This is little tricky, in ‘obj.launch_any_app(path_of_app=path)’ function you need to pass the path of your ‘.exe’ file.

So we have created ‘dict_app’ dictionary which is having a ‘app name’ as key and ‘path’ as value. We can use this ‘dict_app’ for lookup. If user input app exist in dictionary then we will open it by fetching path.

The below example is only for Chrome and Epic Games.

while True:
    res = obj.mic_input()

    if re.search('launch', res):
        dict_app = {
            'chrome': 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe',
            'epic games': 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Epic Games\Launcher\Portal\Binaries\Win32\EpicGamesLauncher.exe'
        }

        app = res.split(' ', 1)[1]
        path = dict_app.get(app)
        if path is None:
            t2s('Application path not found')
            print('Application path not found')
        else:
            t2s('Launching: ' + app)
            obj.launch_any_app(path_of_app=path)
Greetings and Chat, you can create greetings and chat like this for now.

I am working on https://pypi.org/project/JarvisAI/ to add chat kind of functionality using Tensorflow. You can contribute to make it better.

while True:
    res = obj.mic_input()

    if re.search('hello', res):
        print('Hi')
        t2s('Hi')

    if re.search('how are you', res):
        li = ['good', 'fine', 'great']
        response = random.choice(li)
        print(f"I am {response}")
        t2s(f"I am {response}")

    if re.search('your name|who are you', res):
        print("My name is Jarvis, I am your personal assistant")
        t2s("My name is Jarvis, I am your personal assistant")
Ask- ‘What can you do?’: Here simply we are using ‘obj.t2s()’to produce some speech. If you know python, you will easily understand the code below-

while True:
    res = obj.mic_input()

    if re.search('what can you do', res):
        li_commands = {
            "open websites": "Example: 'open youtube.com",
            "time": "Example: 'what time it is?'",
            "date": "Example: 'what date it is?'",
            "launch applications": "Example: 'launch chrome'",
            "tell me": "Example: 'tell me about India'",
            "weather": "Example: 'what weather/temperature in Mumbai?'",
            "news": "Example: 'news for today' ",
        }
        ans = """I can do lots of things, for example you can ask me time, date, weather in your city,
        I can open websites for you, launch application and more. See the list of commands-"""
        print(ans)
        pprint.pprint(li_commands)
        t2s(ans)
